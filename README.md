## üîç Browser Support

- **Modern Browsers** - Chrome 88+, Firefox 85+, Safari 14+, Edge 88+
- **ES6 Modules** - Required for module system
- **CSS Custom Properties** - Required for theming
- **Fetch API** - Required for data loading

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Chords not being recognized:**
- Use standard notation: `C`, `Am`, `F#`, `Bb7`, `Cmaj7`
- Sharp notes: `F#`, `C#`, `G#` (use # symbol)
- Flat notes: `Bb`, `Eb`, `Ab` (use b letter)
- Complex chords: `Cmaj7`, `Dm7`, `G7sus4`

**App not loading:**
- Must be served over HTTP/HTTPS (not opened as file://)
- Check browser console for errors
- Try a different web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Ensure internet connection for first load

**Cursor jumping while typing:**
- This should be fixed! Report if you still see this issue
- Try typing slower if problem persists
- Refresh page as workaround

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Guitar Diagrams** - Visual chord fingerings for guitar/bass
- [ ] **Piano Visualization** - Piano keyboard chord visualization  
- [ ] **MIDI Support** - Import/export chord progressions as MIDI
- [ ] **Audio Playback** - Play chord progressions using Web Audio

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Recent Fixes (Latest)

**Fixed F# Chord Recognition:**
- Problem: `F#` was being matched as just `F`
- Solution: Improved regex to properly handle accidentals (#, b, ‚ôØ, ‚ô≠)
- Now correctly recognizes: `F#`, `Bb`, `C#m7`, `Abmaj7`, etc.

**Fixed Cursor Jumping:**
- Problem: Typing cursor would jump backward during chord formatting
- Solution: Better selection preservation during DOM manipulation
- Now maintains cursor position while typing

**Front-End Optimizations:**
- Pure client-side application (no server required)
- Improved performance monitoring and error handling
- Better accessibility with ARIA labels and keyboard shortcuts

### Testing
To test the fixes, try typing:
```
F# Bb C# Eb
F#maj7 Bbm7 C#dim Eb7sus4
```

Both chord recognition and cursor position should work smoothly now!
